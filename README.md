## Problem Statement
Bangladesh's drug market is huge, and antibiotic drugs make up a significant portion of it. In this project, we will provide an overview of the current antibiotics market in Bangladesh. We will also explore the prices of some commonly prescribed antibiotics across several top brands.

We would like to thank <a href="https://medex.com.bd/">MedEx</a>, from which we have extracted data for 3,700 antibiotic products for this analysis.

## The Goals
In this analysis, we will focus on the following points:

1. Identifying the most widely produced antibiotic generics in Bangladesh.  
2. Highlighting the top antibiotic manufacturers in Bangladesh.  
3. Examining company specializations in various dosage forms.  
4. Analyzing the strength, packaging, and pricing of commonly prescribed antibiotics.  
5. Comparing the unit prices of commonly available antibiotics across top brands.  
6. Comparing the daily minimum wage with the per-unit prices of common antibiotics in different strengths.
